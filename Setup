What should be the resolution for enemy collisions?
Undoing wall collisions may end in a subsequent collision as the player undo's
the wall collision, how should it be resolved?


Restriction that enemies don't move

Player Moves (testing against a special static queue)

Objects Move (Ones that are static are added special queue)
Then get added to Collisions buckets

Then objects attempt to collide
Then if necessary objects are moved because of collisions
